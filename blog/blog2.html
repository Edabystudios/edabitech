    <p>With the high demand for fast, reliable delivery, especially in urban areas, a small-scale delivery service could be profitable. With N50k, you can start delivering for local businesses or individuals, handling small errands. Focus on popular items like food and parcel deliveries. This business requires only a reliable means of transportation and good customer service.</p>

    <h3>8. Perfume Oil Reselling</h3>
    <p>Perfume oils are popular and cost-effective products that can be sold at a premium. With N50k, you can purchase a variety of scents in bulk, then bottle and brand them attractively. Selling perfume oils is low-risk and appeals to students, professionals, and fragrance enthusiasts.</p>
